# fire-risk-calculation-system
The Fire Risk Calculation System (FRCS) is a desktop application developed as part of a university project at the University of Western Macedonia. The system aims to predict the likelihood of forest fires in Greece by analyzing sensor data from forested areas and providing early warnings to authorities and citizens.

# Key features

## 1. Fire Risk Prediction
Calculates fire probability and danger index for forested areas using sensor data (temperature, humidity, terrain slope, fuel quantity). Highlights high-risk zones for prioritized firefighting response.

## 2. Multi-User Access
Admin: Manages sensors, users, and calculation parameters.
Generic User: Views predictions and triggers alerts.

## 3. Sensor Management
Add/remove sensors with geolocation and custom parameters.
Real-time connectivity checks and data validation.

## 4. Alert System
Automated email notifications to authorities and citizens via mailing lists.
Customizable alert thresholds based on risk levels.

## 5. Data Visualization
Displays current/past sensor readings (averages, min/max values).
Interactive dashboard for risk assessment.

## 6. Customizable Models
Adjustable fire-risk formulas for different forest types/climates (e.g., Australian bushfire models).
