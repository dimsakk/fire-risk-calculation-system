Dear recipients, please exercise extreme caution near the following forests:
Strofilia
Volou

Please take the following precautions immediately:

1.Stay informed: Listen to local news updates, radio broadcasts, or check official social media channels for the latest updates on the fire's progression, evacuation orders, and safety guidelines.

2.Pack an emergency kit: Prepare a bag with essential items such as non-perishable food, drinking water, medications, clothing, important documents, flashlights, and batteries. Keep this kit readily accessible in case of evacuation.

3.Create a defensible space: Clear any dry vegetation or debris from your property to create a buffer zone between your home and the approaching fire. Trim overhanging tree branches and remove flammable materials from your yard.

4.Evacuation plan: Familiarize yourself with evacuation routes and know multiple ways to exit your neighborhood. If instructed to evacuate, leave immediately, following the designated routes and guidelines provided by local authorities.

5.Monitor air quality: Forest fires can produce hazardous smoke and pollutants. Stay indoors as much as possible and use air purifiers or create a clean air room by sealing windows and doors with damp towels to prevent smoke infiltration.

6.Keep communication devices charged: Ensure your mobile phones, radios, and other communication devices are fully charged and keep spare batteries or power banks handy. Regularly check for emergency alerts and stay in touch with friends, family, and neighbors.

7.Be vigilant and report fires: If you notice any signs of fire or smoke, promptly report it to the emergency services. Do not attempt to extinguish a large fire yourself; instead, focus on your safety and follow evacuation procedures.

8.Follow official instructions: Pay close attention to instructions and warnings issued by local authorities and emergency services. Cooperate fully with their directives and respect any mandatory evacuation orders for your safety.

Remember, in times of emergency, it is crucial to remain calm and act swiftly. Look out for your neighbors, especially those who may require assistance, and together, we can overcome this challenge.
